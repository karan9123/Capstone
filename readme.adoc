= A comparative study of type safe modular hash consing in Haskell and Rust


== Introduction

This capstone project explores the concept and implementation of hash consing, a technique for sharing immutable structured data. The project involves developing hash consing libraries in two prominent programming languages: Haskell and Rust. These languages are chosen for their distinct features and capabilities, making the study comprehensive and diverse.

Hash consing is particularly useful in functional programming and systems where memory efficiency and data sharing are paramount. It involves identifying and reusing identical data structures, thus reducing memory footprint and potentially improving performance.

The Haskell portion of the project focuses on developing a pure, single-threaded, and thread-safe version of the hash consing library. Haskell's emphasis on pure functional programming and its advanced type system provide a unique environment to implement hash consing.

1. *Pure Library*: The pure version in Haskell stays true to functional programming paradigms, ensuring immutability and referential transparency.
2. *Single-Threaded Weak Pointer Version*: This version uses Haskell's weak pointers to manage memory more efficiently, ensuring that unnecessary data is garbage collected.
3. *Thread-Safe Weak Pointer Version*: Extending the single-threaded version, this implementation focuses on concurrency and thread safety, a critical aspect in modern computing environments.

The Rust portion addresses the same concept in a system programming context, leveraging Rust's unique features like ownership and lifetimes.

1. *Single-Threaded Version with Rc*: Utilizing Rust's `Rc` (Reference Counted) pointers, this version implements hash consing for single-threaded applications, focusing on memory safety without the overhead of thread synchronization.
2. *Thread-Safe Version with Arc*: For multi-threaded scenarios, this version uses `Arc` (Atomic Reference Counted) pointers to safely manage shared data across threads, showcasing Rust's capabilities in handling concurrency with safety.

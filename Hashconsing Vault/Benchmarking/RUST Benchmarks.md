### Insights from the Table:
1. **Time Efficiency**: The non-hash-consed approach is consistently faster across all uniqueness levels, indicating that hash-consing introduces a significant time overhead.

2. **Memory Allocation and Deallocation**: 
   - The total bytes allocated are similar between the two methods, but hash-consing tends to deallocate more memory. This suggests more efficient memory usage in the hash-consed approach.
   - The discrepancy in bytes deallocated becomes more pronounced as the uniqueness percentage increases, reaching its peak at 67% uniqueness.

3. **Reallocation Events**: The number of reallocations is identical for both approaches across all tests, suggesting similar patterns of dynamic memory resizing.

4. **Table Length and Vector Length**: 
   - The hash-consed table length increases with the percentage of uniqueness, indicating more unique entries are being stored as uniqueness increases.
   - The vector length remains constant or nearly constant across all tests, indicating a consistent workload size.

5. **Bytes Utilized (Non-Hash-Consed)**: Increases with the uniqueness, which could imply more efficient memory utilization in scenarios with higher uniqueness percentages.

In conclusion, the hash-consed approach shows better memory management efficiency (in terms of deallocation) at the cost of increased time, while the non-hash-consed approach is consistently faster but less efficient in memory deallocation, particularly at higher levels of uniqueness.
